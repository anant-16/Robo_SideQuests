# Day 1 – Project Setup & First Light Detection

**Date:** 09-02-2026 

Just getting started with working on electronic components, building simple projects for and my main goal is to become the ultimate cool robotics guy ;)

The goal of the project was to build a "smart night lamp" system, and my objective was to learn the working of LM393 LDR module, BC547 transistor and Arduino UNO of course. I understand it is a fairly simple task but hey its just the beginning :)
LDR module senses ambient light, the onboard potentiometer (which is pre-installed in the LDR module) defines the darkness threshold, when it gets dark, the module output (DO) goes LOW and the Arduino detects this signal and turns ON the transistor and the led lights up.
I can't wait to start my second project, it was very fun tbh.

Code (Day 1)
