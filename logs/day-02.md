# Day 2 – Touchless Doorbell
**Date:** 12-02-2026 

I tried to build a touchless doorbell using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and a HYDZ buzzer, the main goal was to learn distance sensing and how arduino processer time-based signals.
So basically it senses anything at a distance of 8 or less units and as soon as it detects something the buzzer responds.
