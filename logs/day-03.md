# Day 3 – Ultrasonic Distance Indicator

**Date:** 12-02-2026

I built an ultrasonic distance indicator using the **Arduino Uno**, **HC-SR04**, 5 LEDs, and a HYDZ buzzer. The goal was to understand how distance is calculated using echo pulse timing and how different distance ranges can control multiple outputs.

The system measures distance continuously, lights up LEDs based on how close an object is, and increases buzzer speed as the object gets nearer.

Code (Day 3)

Arduino sketch: Ultrasonicdistancedetector.ino
